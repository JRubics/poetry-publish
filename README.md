[![Latest release](https://badgen.net/github/release/JRubics/poetry-publish)](https://github.com/JRubics/poetry-publish/releases)

An action to build and publish python package to [PyPI](https://pypi.org/), [TestPyPI](https://test.pypi.org/) or a private wheels repo using [poetry](https://github.com/python-poetry/poetry).

## Inputs

### `python_version`

The version of python to install (default: latest). Use default for a shorter build time.

### `poetry_version`

The version of poetry to install (default: latest).

### `pypi_token`

**Required** API token to authenticate when uploading package to PyPI (You can find your token [here](https://pypi.org/manage/account/)).

### `repository_name`

The name of a repository where the package will be uploaded. Necessary if you'd like to upload to test PyPi or a private wheels repo. Uploads to official PyPi if not informed.

### `repository_url`

The URL where the package will be uploaded. Necessary if you'd like to upload to test PyPi or a private wheels repo. Uploads to official PyPi if not informed.

### `repository_username`

The Username to log in into a repository where the package will be uploaded if using http-basic authentification instead of api token.

### `repository_password`

The Password to log in into a repository where the package will be uploaded if using http-basic authentification instead of api token.

### `build_format`

By default, poetry's build command outputs two formats: **wheel** and **sdist**. If you intend to use
only one of them, you may specify that with the `build_format` parameter.

### `ignore_dev_requirements`

This will instruct poetry **not** to install any developer requirements. this may lead to an overall quicker experience.

### `allow_poetry_pre_release`

Allow poetry pre-release versions to be installed.

### `extra_build_dependency_packages`

An optional space-separated list of debian packages to be installed before building the package

### `plugins`

An optional space-separated list of poetry plugins to be installed before building the package

### `package_directory`

An optional subdirectory path if poetry package doesn't reside in the main workflow directory


## Example usage

The following will build and publish the python package to the PyPI using the last version of python and poetry. Specify the python package version and dependencies in `pyproject.toml` in the root directory of your project.

```yaml
- name: Build and publish to pypi
  uses: JRubics/poetry-publish@v1.17
  with:
    pypi_token: ${{ secrets.PYPI_TOKEN }}
```

Python and poetry versions can be specified in inputs as well as the build_format, allow_poetry_pre_release and ignore_dev_requirements.

```yaml
- name: Build and publish to pypi
  uses: JRubics/poetry-publish@v1.17
  with:
    python_version: "3.7.1"
    poetry_version: "==1.0.5" # (PIP version specifier syntax)
    pypi_token: ${{ secrets.PYPI_TOKEN }}
    build_format: "sdist"
    allow_poetry_pre_release: "yes"
    ignore_dev_requirements: "yes"
```

Repository can be changed to TestPyPI or a private wheels repo by specifying repository_name and repository_url.

```yaml
- name: Build and publish to pypi
  uses: JRubics/poetry-publish@v1.17
  with:
    pypi_token: ${{ secrets.PYPI_TOKEN }}
    repository_name: "testpypi"
    repository_url: "https://test.pypi.org/legacy/"
```

Repository authentication can be changed to http-basic authentification by specifying repository_username and repository_password instead of pypi_token.

```yaml
- name: Build and publish to private Python package repository
  uses: JRubics/poetry-publish@v1.17
  with:
    repository_name: "foo"
    repository_url: "https://foo.bar/simple/"
    repository_username: "username"
    repository_password: "password"
```

Extra debian packages can be installed before building the python package. This is particularly useful for packages that do not need to be included in the base image for this action.

```yaml
- name: Build and publish to pypi
  uses: JRubics/poetry-publish@v1.17
  with:
    pypi_token: ${{ secrets.PYPI_TOKEN }}
    extra_build_dependency_packages: "capnproto libzmq3-dev"
```

Poetry plugins can be added by specifying plugins input

```yaml
- name: Build and publish to pypi
  uses: JRubics/poetry-publish@v1.17
  with:
    pypi_token: ${{ secrets.PYPI_TOKEN }}
    plugins: "poetry-dynamic-versioning-plugin"
```

Poetry package can be built from a subdirectory. It should be specified as package_directory

```yaml
- name: Build and publish to pypi
  uses: JRubics/poetry-publish@v1.17
  with:
    pypi_token: ${{ secrets.PYPI_TOKEN }}
    package_directory: "subdirectory"
```

## Example workflow

The following will build and publish the python package when project is tagged in the `v*.*.*` form.

```yaml
name: Python package
on:
  push:
    tags:
      - "v*.*.*"
jobs:
  build:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    steps:
      - uses: actions/checkout@v3
      - name: Build and publish to pypi
        uses: JRubics/poetry-publish@v1.17
        with:
          pypi_token: ${{ secrets.PYPI_TOKEN }}
```
